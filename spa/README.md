# SPA

## What can be done different

- Make responsive
- Validation for input fields
- Better design
- Break monolith App.js into small components and unit test each one separately
- Error logging (client side telemetry)
- Handle error states (e.g. "Could not save event")
- Extract save event functionality into a React hook so that it can be reused
