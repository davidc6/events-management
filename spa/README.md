## What can be improved

- Add tests
- Add state management if the application grows in complexity
- Add React Query for caching and fetching data
- Make the app responsive and mobile friendly
- Add client side validation for input fields (add new event)
- Error logging (client side telemetry)
- Handle error states / fallback states (e.g. "Could not save event")
- Extract "save event" functionality into a React hook so that it can be reused
- Allow for environment variable to swap API url
- Serve the application behind teh reverse proxy to cache static assets and for improved security
- Better design
